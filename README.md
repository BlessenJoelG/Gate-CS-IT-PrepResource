## Repo structure
- /syllabus/ — official syllabus split by subject & topic
- /notes/ — short, curated notes (PDF/Markdown)
- /papers/ — previous-year papers, with solved answers
- /weightages/ — CSV/MD reports showing topic frequencies
- /mistakes/ — journal-style entries documenting past exam mistakes
- /study-plans/ — recommended schedules and checkpoints
- /resources.md — books, video playlists, and helpful links

---

## How to use this repo (3 steps)
1. Browse `/syllabus/` and match it with `/notes/` for every topic.
2. Check `/weightages/` to identify high-priority topics (start here).
3. Practice with `/papers/` and review mistakes in `/mistakes/`. Repeat weak topics using targeted notes.

Tip: Follow a weekly cycle — Learn → Practice (past-year questions) → Revise → Log mistakes.

  - Weeks 5–8: DBMS, Networks, Theory of Computation
  - Weeks 9–12: Compilers, CS Math, Revision + Papers

- 6-month balanced
  - Months 1–3: Finish core syllabus + topic tests
  - Months 4–5: Advanced topics + full-length mocks
  - Month 6: Revision, formulas, last 5 years papers

- 1-year deep prep
  - Spread topics evenly, monthly milestones, semester-style mastery

## Topic weightages — what to prioritise
We analyze past papers and tag topics by frequency and marks contribution. Focus first on:
1. Data Structures & Algorithms (highest)
2. Operating Systems
3. Database Systems
4. Computer Networks
5. Theory of Computation & Discrete Maths
6. Compiler Design, Software Engineering, AI/ML (lower but important)

See `/weightages/summary.md` for detailed charts and a downloadable CSV.

## Mistakes I've made — learn from me
This repo contains an honest, timestamped log of mistakes such as:
- Underestimating DS/Algo practice time — solved by daily 1–2 problems routine.
- Ignoring negative marking strategy — learned to practice accuracy & time management.
- Not revising formula sheet — now maintain a one-page “must-know” sheet per subject.
- Over-reliance on single source — diversified notes & solved earlier papers.

Each entry in `/mistakes/` shows the mistake, root cause, corrective action, and suggested exercises.

---

## Practice tips & exam strategy
- Solve previous-year papers in timed conditions (strict stopwatch).
- After each paper, grade yourself and add mistakes to `/mistakes/`.
- Maintain a “Top 50” formula/idea sheet for quick revision.
- Do targeted mini-sessions: 30–45 minutes focused on one weak topic.
- Weekly mock review: analyze time spent per question and revise strategy.

Terminal-style quick plan (copyable):
```bash
# 6-week micro plan example (daily tasks)
for day in {1..42}; do
  study_topic --priority high
  practice_problems 5
  revise_notes 20m
  log_mistakes
done
```
